## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>  


My third project is a football quiz. A large part of the inspiration for this project comes from my love for football and I be;ieve all football fans will enjoy it as much as I do, by testing their knowledge about the football world.

## UX Strategy

<br/> 

### The Business Goals of the Website: <a name="businessgoals"></a>
- No commercial goals, but the site's goal is to to provide an interactive quiz.
  
  <br/> 

### The Target Customer: <a name="targetcustomer"></a>

- The audience of the site could encompass a number of age groups and there would generally not be any   limitation on who could not play.   
       
- Would probably require some access to digital technology(not mobile).      
- May be useful for a user who has spare time and enjoys football.

## User Stories

<br>

### As a first time user and a regular user to this site, I want to:
- Understand how the Game Works.
- Play the Game.
- See if my answer was correct
- See the correct answer
- See the leaderboard

 <br/>

### As the site owner, I want to:
- Build more complexity in the game, so it is more challenging to the user.
- Add more quiz categories to give the user a wider range of experiences.
- Offer a wider range of settings within the game(i.e. difficulty of the questions).

## Theme

The site encompasses the html index page and the terminal screen. I wanted to have a background image that resonates with the theme of the game.

## Testing



 ## Deployment

 ### How to make a local Clone
1. Navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Click the green Code Button at top right of the repository.
3. Copy the url for the repository.
4. Open Git Bash and Change the current working directory to where you want the cloned directory.
5. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you previously copied using $ git clone. 
6. Pressing enter will then create your clone.  

<br/>  


### How to fork a GitHub Repository
1. Log into GitHub and go to the required Repository.
2. The Fork button is found at the top right corner of the page.
3. When you click this button you will have a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

 ### Student Template
 This Template has been provided by the Code Institute and includes a number of tools to make life easier and has been used within this present site.    

<br/>

### Deploying to Heroku
- After registering on the Heroku site, you can see the dashboard. You can select 'New' and then click 'Create new app'. You need to pick a unique name for your app, it will let you know if it is  to available to use.
- Select your region and create your app.
- Go to the settings tab and scroll until you find the config vars section and pick 'Reveal config vars',
in this case I added 'PORT' into the key field and added '8000' into the value field and click 'add'.
- If you have credentials, for your project, you must create another config vars called 'CREDS' and 
you would paste the JSON into the value field.
- You have to to the builldpacks section and click 'add buildpack'.
- In this case I added 'Python' and 'saved changes, and did the same with 'Node'.
- Next you go to the Deploy tab and you select 'github' and confirm connection to your GitHub Account.
- You search for your project repository and click to 'connect'.
- Under the deploy options, you can chose automatic deploys, this allow you to automatically deploy each
time you push to your Repository.
- To deploy, you would choose what branch you want to deploy and click on 'Deploy Branch'.
- It takes a little time to build your app but when it is ready you can open your app by using the link
provided
