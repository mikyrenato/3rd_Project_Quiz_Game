## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>  


Where Evil Dwells is a Text Based Adventure for a Command Line Interface. It is utilizing the python language.
The Game is a murder mystery based in a Creepy House. The Player acts as the protagonist and will drive the direction of the game. The decision making will allow the player to interact with the characters and they can experience different scenarios according to their choices. This is an original story based on the vintage horror/thriller genre with inspiration from the classic movie, 'Murder by Death'. The goal of the game is to make it to the end of the game alive and be able to claim the inheritance. The hope is that the game will offer the player an interactive and fun experience, that they can repeat and experience differently each time they play.

## UX Strategy <a name="uxstrategy"></a>

<br/> 

### The Business Goals of the Website: <a name="businessgoals"></a>
- No commercial goals, but the site's goal is to to provide an interactive 'Choose your Own Adventure'.
  
  <br/> 

### The Target Customer: <a name="targetcustomer"></a>

- The audience of the site could encompass a number of age groups and there would generally not be any   limitation on who could not play.   
       
- Would probably require some access to digital technology(not mobile).      
- May be useful for a user who has spare time and enjoys using decision making to solve a mystery.      
- Someone who likes interaction in their gaming.

## Layout  <a name="layout"></a> 

<br/>


## Theme    <a name="theme"></a>  

The site encompasses the html index page and the terminal screen. I wanted to have a background image that resonates with the theme of the game. I simply applied a background image of a creepy house. In regards to the interface i added aasci art images to supplement the settings depicted in the text. The background colours were used to make certain elements stand out i.e. the letter. Colour was applied to prompts, to make them stand out from the rest of the text flow. Colour was also used when the player dies in the game(red) as it is synonymous with danger.

<br>

## UX Experience    <a name="ux"></a>

- The player is given a backstory on what they need to do in the game.
- The player can choose to see the instructions for the game.
- The player is prompted when a decision needs to be made.
- The prompts are designed to stand out from the rest of the text.
- Validation allows the Player multiple attempts of getting inputs right.
- Player is allowed to see more information on guests before deciding on a buddy.

<br>

### ABOUT BLOODY CAMP TRIAL FONT: 
Bloody Camp is a horror blood font, which creates a horror tone and felt it supplemented the
horror theme of the game. I tried to accentuate the horror mode by selecting a nice rich font
that is a true type font, and I used it as an image one the site. The site allowed you to set
the color and scale of the image.

<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/images/hauntedhouse.jpg"  alt="background to the game" />    
</p>
<br/> 

The background image was sourced again to supplement the horror theme and the setting of the
game is in a house, so I thought it was fitting that the user can visualize the environment that the game is depicting and soak up the atmosphere.

<br>

The rest of the images consist of aasci art sourced from an online generator and a free resource that contains different images by category, I choose images that set the scene for various settings within the game. I did not overdo this as I didn't want to distract the player too much from game play.

## Flow Chart for the Game  <a name="flowchart"></a>

<br>

I created a flow chart in Draw.io, which helped me to focus on how the game should flow. The first stage of the game is the intro where the user gets information on how to play the game, there is a little exploration of the settings and the hook would be the warning, which steers the player to make decisions that will set their course for future play. There are 4 main paths that the player can chose, where the user will have a customized experience and ultimately the end result will be revealed to the user.

<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/images/guests.png"  alt="Introduction to other guests" />    
</p>

<br/> 


### Warning Letter      <a name="warningletter"></a>

The letter is the key part of the game, as it drives the action from this moment on, it spurs the player into action. It is so important that the user has two chances of seeing the contents.


<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/images/letter.png"  alt="Warning letter for the player" />    
</p>

<br/>

### Guest Details       <a name="guestdetails"></a>

Before choosing a buddy for the game, the player is given the opportunity to see more details on one or all of the guests before their choice. They will not see details outside of what is needed for this choice. Certain details are hidden and can be used for future development.
<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/images/guestdetails.png"  alt="Guest details for the player" />    
</p>

<br/> 

### Random Element      <a name="random"></a>

In regards to choosing a buddy and choosing a random safety item, an element of randomness has been introduced, in that the player can choose to be assigned a random buddy and a random safety item and take their chances in the game.

<br>

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/images/random.png"  alt="Random element in game" />    
</p>

<br/> 

### Different Paths in the Game    <a name="paths"></a>

There are Four major paths in the game, determined by the player's choice for their buddy, after buddy selection, an introduction to the character will be displayed and a location for your particular path. Then there will be a series of events with prompts for input from the player. These inputs will decide their fate in the game. They can choose to escape the game, in which case they survive but they forfeit their inheritance. If they chose wrongly they can be killed by the killer. If they make it to the end of the game they will find out if their buddy was the killer or if they have survived the night. If they survive they will be shown a survivor message and will be able to leave the game.

 ## Future Implementation  <a name="future"></a>

 <br>

 The game is set within a house, so there are limitation in regards to location, but there is
 scope to encompass more settings witin future iterations. The player could choose to travel
 to far off locations and explore different terrains and mix with a greater range of people.
 Within the present game the killer is randomly chosen so in regards to clues, these were not
 practical. In future work a killer could be chosen deliberately and clues could be provided 
 so that the user could detect the culprit and stop him from the final attack. You could chose
 to solve tasks and be rewarded with various clues to the identity of the killer, in this way
 you could add more comlexity to the game and increase the engagement of the player.

 In the present game there are only 6 characters(including the player) and there are 4 character 
 paths, you could also include further characters and more character paths to give
 the player more routes through the game. THe different character paths could also be longer
 and this would allow the player to experience a broader experience of the game.

### User Story Testing<a name="userstorytesting"></a>

 <br/>

#### As a first time user to the site

- Understand how the Game Works.
- Play the Game.
- If I want to restart a Game, I want to be able to do this easily.

The game consists of a series of prompts, and the answers are highlighted to the user in advance. If
you choose to play, each stage of the game will lead you through the gameplay. If you want to restart
the game, currently you need to use the button above the game interface.

<br>

#### As a regular user of the site, I want to …...  

- I want to try the various scenarios to navigate through the game.     
- I want to avail of all the options to have different experiences.        
- I want more complexity and a greater range of scenarios within the game.
  
As a user you can choose different paths in the game and you can choose to partner with a different buddy which
will also allow you to experience a different setting within the House. You can also take your chance with a 
random buddy or a random protection item to experience more of a game of chance.

<br>

#### As the site owner, I want to …..    
- Build more complexity in the game, so it is more challenging to the user.
- Add more scenarios to give the user a wider range of experiences.
- Offer a wider range of settings within the game.
- In the present game, the killer is picked at random, so clues would be unhelpful, 
 but in future games, clues and red herrings could be added to create more of an 
 investigative  experience, where the killer can be identified by the player.
- Provide the user with more decision making opportunities.

The current game has a good foundation for future development. The classes can be utilizied to increase
the complexity. The house has a few rooms at the moment but there is the possibility of increasing the range of the current internal settings. Increase the characters and lengtening the paths within the game.

<br>

### General Testing   <a name="general"></a>

<br>

#### Browser Testing

The site was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft edge, and there seemed to be no
issues on any of the browsers.

<br>


#### Responsive Testing

In regards to responsive testing, the Terminal does not work on smaller screens so just tested for the
bigger screens. It seemed to have no issues as the content is aligned to the center.

<br>

<p align ="center">

</p>
<br/> 

<br>

### Validation      <a name="validation"></a>

<br>

I used pep8 validation to test the 4 pages and no errors were found (See images below)

     <img src="assets/images/readme/images/pep8art.png"  alt="pep8 for art.py" />    
</p>
<br/> 

<br>

#### HTML Checker     

I tested the index page with W3C checked and it validated cleanly. I had added the css file in an 
external file but it didn't work in Heroku and so left css inline.

<p align ="center">      
     <img src="assets/images/readme/images/htmlchecker.png"  alt="HTML Validation" />    
</p>
<br/>


#### Lighthouse Testing

I tend to have issues using lighouse in general, but the results seem to be generally alright. It did note some vulnerabilities but this was with existing code in the templates, so could not fix them.

 ## Bugs and Issues  <a name="bugs"></a>

<br>

 ### Resolved <a name="resolved"></a>

 Most of the original bugs were centered on path choice and figuring how to bypass other parts of the game, just when you thought you had it figured, it would end up on a completly different path. In regards to validation the whole way through I had devised an else in each prompt so that the game would continue even if the wrong input was given. I did not want to penalize a player for getting it wrong, but fundamentally this was wrong as I was making the decisions for the player and that would not be a good user experience. So I added validation in the later stages of the project, adding 'While True' and asking the users for the correct input, in this way the user can't be wrong.

 I had problems with the name validation, I was trying to use a regex and it didn't work right, so again at the later stages I added validation within the name function itself. Now it will repeat the prompt until the user gives a name with only words, can not the field blank or have numbers in the string. 

 There is a random element to the game, the killer is picked at random, the buddy is assigned if user chooses this option and also for the safety item, this was a last minute decision, and decided to make it a choice as apposed to the result of bad input.  At on point the random assigned buddy was always 'Brad', but this has been since fixed
 
 <br>

 ### Unresolved <a name="unresolved"></a>

 I was going to use a clear function, but the game does not lend itself too well to that, there is no set size between prompts and there are so many routes to choose, it could be problematic, although I would hope to improve the flow of the game in future iterations. If the player needs to finish the game, they are given several options throughout the game to leave, but if you were to start the game, the way I originally had used earlier in development(options for player), there were problems in allocating the random killer at the start of the game, so instead the user can leave at the end of the game and use the run programme button to begin again. I don't think this is a fault as such, but if you have the technology at hand, it seems wrong not to implement it fully.

 There was some last minute issues in regard to the terminal, I think the page needs to be refreshed to ensure randomness is guaranteed (The run programme button does not reload the programme from the start fully), Would hope to come up with a valid long term solution moving forward. If random options are not chosen it should work out ok. This is an intermittant problem and seems to right itself but if it is a consistant killer it needs refreshing.

in this case I added 'PORT' into the key field and added '8000' into the value field and click 'add'.
- If you have credentials, for your project, you must create another config vars called 'CREDS' and 
you would paste the JSON into the value field.
- You have to to the builldpacks section and click 'add buildpack'.
- In this case I added 'Python' and 'saved changes, and did the same with 'Node'.
- Next you go to the Deploy tab and you select 'github' and confirm connection to your GitHub Account.
- You search for your project repository and click to 'connect'.
- Under the deploy options, you can chose automatic deploys, this allow you to automatically deploy each

On Stack Overflow I found information in relation to writing text on screen at different speeds, and I used it for various texts imported from narration.py (see below)


 for character in x:<br>
    sys.stdout.write(character)<br>
    sys.stdout.flush()<br>
    time.sleep()<br>
